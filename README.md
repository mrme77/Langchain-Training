# LangChain Training ðŸ¦œðŸ”— Revised Fork

This repository is a revised fork of the original LangChain course created by **Harrish Neel**. The original course provides a comprehensive introduction to LangChain, covering various integrations, models, and workflows for building applications with language models. 

In this revised fork, I have focused on **leveraging the content with Ollama and Gemma models**, enhancing the examples and workflows to demonstrate their capabilities in various scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### 1. `1_chat_models/`
This directory contains examples of using different chat models, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and Ollama. Key files include:
- **`1_chat_models_starter.py`**: Basic example of using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
- **`2_chat_models_ollama.py`**: Demonstrates the use of Ollama's `gemma3:12b-it-qat` model.
- **`5_chat_ollama_firebase_history.py`**: Integrates Ollama with Firebase Firestore to save and retrieve chat message history.

### 2. `2_prompt_templates/`
This directory focuses on creating and using prompt templates for various tasks. Examples include templates for Gemini and other models.

### 3. `3_chains/`
This directory explores LangChain's chain functionality, including:
- **`3_chains_gemini.py`**: Demonstrates chaining prompts with the Google Gemini model.
- **`4_chains_parallel.py`**: Shows how to run multiple chains in parallel using Ollama.

### 4. `4_RAGs/`
This directory focuses on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows:
- **`1a_basic_rag_ollama.py`**: Demonstrates creating a vector store and using Ollama for RAG.
- **`2a_rag_basics_metadata.py`**: Explores metadata handling in RAG workflows.

### 5. `5_agents/`
This directory contains examples of using LangChain agents for dynamic task execution.
